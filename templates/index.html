    Crisp autumn mornings complete with the brisk aroma of a dark roast coffee sitting idyllicly on your porch.
    Sweet, creamy clouds atop an ice-cold frappacino before your first college class of the day.
    Bold, yet swift burst of energy for those late nights you put in.
  </p>
  <p>
    No matter where you are in the world, one thing brings us all together: coffee.
  </p>
  <p>
    Perhaps you are brand new to coffee and would like to take your first step into this lovely world.
    Or, perhaps you have been an avid consumer of coffee for as long as you can remember.
    Anyone is welcome in the Coffee Lover's Club.

        Fact #1: Coffee was feared long ago.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why, you wonder, would anyone react with fear to something so wonderful? The wonder of coffee, in fact, was the source of the fear for those in power.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coffee houses were popular areas where people gathered to discuss matters of all sorts. These matters were thought to be conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, the next time someone says that coffee is bad for you, remind them of the power it had to give powerful people a headache.

        Fact #2: Coffee was discovered by a goat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trekking through the vast, open fields of Ethiopia, a goat came across a strange tree blooming with coffee cherries. Naturally, the curious goat decided to eat one.
      </p>
      <p>
        One cherry became many, and with many coffee cherries, the goat's amazing energy levels caught the attention of humans.
      </p>
      <p>
        Be sure to thank a goat next time you see one. Just don't give it any coffee.
