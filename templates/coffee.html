            <p class="coffee-title">Espresso</p>
            <p class="coffee-description">
                Espresso is a concentrated coffee beverage made by forcing hot water
                through finely-ground coffee beans. It's known for its strong flavor and
                relatively small serving size.
            </p>
            <p class="coffee-making">
                Espresso is typically made using an espresso machine, where water is
                pressurized and forced through a "shot" of finely-ground coffee beans.
                The result is a small, intense shot of coffee with a layer of crema on
                top. If you watch a video on how it's made well, you'll see a
                nectar-like orange liquid being filtered into a glass.

            <p class="coffee-title">Americano</p>
            <p class="coffee-description">
                An Americano is a milder coffee beverage that is essentially a diluted
                espresso. It has a flavor profile closer to drip coffee but with the
                strength of espresso.
            </p>
            <p class="coffee-making">
                To make an Americano, you simply add hot water to a shot of espresso.
                The amount of water added can be adjusted to your preference, resulting
                in a weaker or stronger Americano.

            <p class="coffee-description">
                A cappuccino is a coffee drink that consists of equal parts espresso,
                steamed milk, and milk foam. It's known for its balanced and creamy
                taste.
            </p>
            <p class="coffee-making">
                To make a cappuccino, an espresso shot is poured into a cup, followed by
                an equal amount of steamed milk. The top is then adorned with a thick
                layer of milk foam, which is often shaped into decorative patterns.

                A latte is a milder coffee drink made with espresso and a larger amount
                of steamed milk than a cappuccino. It's known for its smooth and creamy
                texture.
            </p>
            <p class="coffee-making">
                A latte starts with a shot of espresso, which is then topped with a

                A mocha is a coffee drink that combines espresso with hot chocolate,
                resulting in a sweet and chocolatey coffee experience.
            </p>
            <p class="coffee-making">
                Mochas typically start with a shot of espresso, which is mixed with hot
                chocolate or cocoa powder. Steamed milk is then added, and the drink is
                often topped with whipped cream and chocolate shavings.

                "Macchiato" means "stained" or "spotted" in Italian. A macchiato is a
                simple coffee drink made by adding a shot of espresso to a small amount
                of frothy milk.
            </p>
            <p class="coffee-making">
                To make a macchiato, a shot of espresso is "stained" or "marked" with a
                small dollop of frothy milk. It's a great choice if you enjoy the
                strength of espresso but want a touch of milk.

                Ristretto is an even more concentrated version of espresso. It's made
                with the same amount of coffee but with less water, resulting in a
                shorter shot with a richer, more intense flavor.
            </p>
            <p class="coffee-making">
                Ristretto is prepared like espresso but with a shorter extraction time,
                using less water. This yields a smaller, more concentrated shot of
                coffee.

                A flat white is a coffee drink that originated in Australia and New
                Zealand. It's similar to a latte but with a velvety microfoam milk
                texture and a strong coffee flavor.
            </p>
            <p class="coffee-making">
                A flat white is made with a shot of espresso and steamed milk. The key
                difference is the texture of the milk, which should have a smooth,
                velvety microfoam rather than a thick layer of foam.

                    Milk Foam: What to Know
                </p>
                <p>
                    By using a steaming wand, hot air is introduced to the liquid, expanding it's volume and
                    creating bubbles (AKA <span>froth</span>). The milk is heated to a specific temperature,
                    typically between 150°F to 170°F (65°C to 75°C), which is below boiling point.
                    The exact temperature may vary depending the type of milk being used. What's important to know is
                    that, at such a temperature, the natural sweetness of the milk comes out. That's also why sugar is
                    never added to many coffee drinks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Technically, froth can be made with any kind of milk, but as a general rule, milk with
                    more fat content is used. This is because the fats produce a rich and creamy foam and a velvetty texture
                    more easily. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can make froth using any of the following tools:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Steam Wand:</span> 
                        In commercial coffee machines, a steam wand is used to inject steam into the milk, 
                        creating foam as the milk expands.
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Handheld Frother:</span>
                        For home use, handheld milk frothers or frothing wands are commonly used. 
                        These devices whisk and aerate the milk to produce foam.
                    </li>
                    <li><span>French Press:</span>
                        Simple, yet effective home tool that contains a plunger to pump coffee
                        or milk. To mimic the introduction of air through a steam wand, people pump
                        the plunger several times.

                    How to Make the Perfect Milk Foam
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's no surprise that making milk foam is a challenge for the beginning coffee connoisseur. Without
                    foam, many
                    espresso-based drinks lose their charm and personality. Here are the steps for making creamy, sweet
                    foam each and every time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For <span>French press</span> users:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Choose a milk of your preference (fattier milk is best) and fill your pitcher about 3/4 of 
                        the way with milk. When introducing air, we are effectively expanding the milk, so you will
                        have room and prevent spils.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Either on the stovetop or using a steam wand, heat the milk to around 150°F to 170°F (65°C to 75°C). 
                        Thermometers are really handy to get precise temperature measurements, but as a general rule, 
                        once you see some smoke, it's time to remove the milk from the heat. Steam wands take care of this for you.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use the hand plunger until satisfied with the milk texture. If, however,
                        you are using a steam wand, read further down about properly introducing air.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>For <span>steam wand</span> users:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Angle the pitcher at a 30-degree angle with the spout facing slightly down. Insert the tip of the wand into the 
                        milk. Most, but not all of the tip should be submerged into the milk. Done correctly, this will create a 
                        whirlpool effect that moves air around the milk and generates great foam.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Start your steam wand, gradually increasing the pressure until you have a decent amount of movement. You
                        can move the pitcher slighly, but it should not be necessary.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Listen to the sound being made. Well-done frothing should be relatively quiet and sound like pressurized liquid.
                        If your milk is making a very high-pitched noise during frothing, your wand tip is too high.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Determine the temperature of the milk by placing one hand on the bottom of the pitcher. Once the bottom of the
                        pitcher is too hot to handle, the milk is ready.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once satisfied with the froth level, turn off the steam wand and wait for a few seconds. Carefully remove the pitcher
                        and wipe the steam wand tip with a wet towel. Clear the space around the wand and let out some steam once more. This 
                        is to remove and residual milk from the wand.

                    Espresso: What to Know
                </p>
                <p>
                    Espresso is a concentrated coffee beverage that is brewed by forcing hot water 
                    through finely-ground coffee beans. In other words, there is a large amount of 
                    flavor compounds that get extracted through hot water, producing a strong, caffeine-packed
                    liquid. A single shot of espresso, 1oz, contains roughly 30 milligrams of caffeine, while a 
                    standard 8oz cup of coffee has 95-165 milligrams. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Adding an espresso shot to a cup of coffee can add up to over 200 milligrams of caffeine
                    in a single serving depending on the size of the shot. Generally, you can consume up to 400 milligrams in 
                    one day without any issues. With that in mind, please drink responsibly!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Crema, a caramel-colored liquid that is made when extracting espresso, is the golden standard for 
                    flavor quality. It is formed when carbon dioxide gas is released during the brewing process 
                    and combines with coffee oils to create a frothy layer. Generating crema requires well-compacted
                    and fine coffee grounds filtered through hot water.
                </p>

                <p>For espresso, you will need the following tools:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Espresso Machine:</span> 
                        Espresso machines are different from typical coffee machines in that they do not use a pot.
                        Instead, they use a portafilter that inserts into the machine just below a hot water dispenser.
                        These machines should come with their own portafilter.
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Portafilter:</span>
                        These look like handles with a section to insert a small steel coffee filter. Coffee grounds are 
                        compacted (or tamped) into the filters directly, which are then inserted into the handle.
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Tamper:</span>
                        These are used to compact the grounds into a dense layer so that water is run through evenly. They
                        are quite heavy and come as a set with an espresso machine.
                    </li>

                <p class="title">
                    How to Make the Perfect Espresso
                </p>
                <p>
                    Making espresso perfectly can be challenging, especially for newcomers to the craft. Take a look
                    at our guide below:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Ensure that your coffee grounds are quite fine: They should be close to powder consistency. You can 
                        either purchase finely-grated grounds or make them yourself using an electric grinder. Any grounds that come
                        out too thick can easily be used for regular coffee, so no need to fret about this step.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Place coffee grounds into the portafilter and use your tamper to compress the grounds evenly. This will 
                        ensure that no pockets of air are present for water to escape. Water moves through the area of least 
                        resistance, so any uneven tamping will result in an uneven flavor extraction. Practice is key!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When satisfied, place the portafilter into the machine and turn it on. Make sure you have a shot glass 
                        or something similar that can catch the liquid. If your liquid comes out evenly with a caramelly
