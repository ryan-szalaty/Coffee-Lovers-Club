      <p class="coffee-title">Espresso</p>
      <p class="coffee-description">
        Espresso is a concentrated coffee beverage made by forcing hot water
        through finely-ground coffee beans. It's known for its strong flavor and
        relatively small serving size.
      </p>
      <p class="coffee-making">
        Espresso is typically made using an espresso machine, where water is
        pressurized and forced through a "shot" of finely-ground coffee beans.
        The result is a small, intense shot of coffee with a layer of crema on
        top. If you watch a video on how it's made well, you'll see a
        nectar-like orange liquid being filtered into a glass.

    <div class="coffee-recipe">
      <p class="coffee-title">Americano</p>
      <p class="coffee-description">
        An Americano is a milder coffee beverage that is essentially a diluted
        espresso. It has a flavor profile closer to drip coffee but with the
        strength of espresso.
      </p>
      <p class="coffee-making">
        To make an Americano, you simply add hot water to a shot of espresso.
        The amount of water added can be adjusted to your preference, resulting
        in a weaker or stronger Americano.

    <div class="coffee-recipe">
      <p class="coffee-title">Cappuccino</p>
      <p class="coffee-description">
        A cappuccino is a coffee drink that consists of equal parts espresso,
        steamed milk, and milk foam. It's known for its balanced and creamy
        taste.
      </p>
      <p class="coffee-making">
        To make a cappuccino, an espresso shot is poured into a cup, followed by
        an equal amount of steamed milk. The top is then adorned with a thick
        layer of milk foam, which is often shaped into decorative patterns.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="coffee-recipe">
      <p class="coffee-title">Latte</p>
      <p class="coffee-description">
        A latte is a milder coffee drink made with espresso and a larger amount
        of steamed milk than a cappuccino. It's known for its smooth and creamy
        texture.
      </p>
      <p class="coffee-making">
        A latte starts with a shot of espresso, which is then topped with a
        larger amount of steamed milk and a small amount of milk foam.
      </p>

    <div class="coffee-recipe">
      <p class="coffee-title">Mocha</p>
      <p class="coffee-description">
        A mocha is a coffee drink that combines espresso with hot chocolate,
        resulting in a sweet and chocolatey coffee experience.
      </p>
      <p class="coffee-making">
        Mochas typically start with a shot of espresso, which is mixed with hot
        chocolate or cocoa powder. Steamed milk is then added, and the drink is
        often topped with whipped cream and chocolate shavings.
      </p>

    <div class="coffee-recipe">
      <p class="coffee-title">Macchiato</p>
      <p class="coffee-description">
        "Macchiato" means "stained" or "spotted" in Italian. A macchiato is a
        simple coffee drink made by adding a shot of espresso to a small amount
        of frothy milk.
      </p>
      <p class="coffee-making">
        To make a macchiato, a shot of espresso is "stained" or "marked" with a
        small dollop of frothy milk. It's a great choice if you enjoy the
        strength of espresso but want a touch of milk.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="coffee-recipe">
      <p class="coffee-title">Ristretto</p>
      <p class="coffee-description">
        Ristretto is an even more concentrated version of espresso. It's made
        with the same amount of coffee but with less water, resulting in a
        shorter shot with a richer, more intense flavor.
      </p>
      <p class="coffee-making">
        Ristretto is prepared like espresso but with a shorter extraction time,
        using less water. This yields a smaller, more concentrated shot of
        coffee.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="coffee-recipe">
      <p class="coffee-title">Flat White</p>
      <p class="coffee-description">
        A flat white is a coffee drink that originated in Australia and New
        Zealand. It's similar to a latte but with a velvety microfoam milk
        texture and a strong coffee flavor.
      </p>
      <p class="coffee-making">
        A flat white is made with a shot of espresso and steamed milk. The key
        difference is the texture of the milk, which should have a smooth,
        velvety microfoam rather than a thick layer of foam.
      </p>

    <div class="coffee-recipe">
      <p class="coffee-title">Affogato</p>
      <p class="coffee-description">
        An affogato is a simple yet delightful dessert made by pouring a shot of
        hot espresso over a scoop of vanilla ice cream or gelato.
      </p>
      <p class="coffee-making">
        To make an affogato, a scoop of vanilla ice cream or gelato is placed in
        a serving glass or dish, and a shot of hot espresso is poured over it.
        The espresso both melts the ice cream and blends with it, creating a
        rich and contrasting combination of hot and cold, bitter and sweet.
      </p>

    <div class="coffee-recipe">
      <p class="coffee-title">Vienna Coffee</p>
      <p class="coffee-description">
        Vienna coffee is a luxurious coffee drink that includes coffee, whipped
        cream, and sometimes chocolate or cocoa powder.
      </p>
      <p class="coffee-making">
        A Vienna coffee starts with a shot of espresso, which is topped with a
        generous dollop of whipped cream. Some versions also include a dusting
        of cocoa powder or grated chocolate for added flavor.
